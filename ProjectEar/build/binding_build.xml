<!--Run this ant file after runnning ear-build.xml only-->
<!-- ear-build.xml ant tasks are now split into two files as 
a) ear-build.xml 
b) binding_build.xml.
ear-build.xml now does not contain the wsdefaultbinding task & it is moved to binding_build.xml. 
For creating the application EAR, first ear-build.xml ant file must be run with the JRE selection as "Run in the same JRE as in workspace". 
For binding task binding_build.xml ant file is run with JRE selected as "separate JRE". 
This is an exceptional case for running wsdefaultbinding task from within the RAD as both wsdefaultbinding & ejbdeploy task are not compatible with each other & can't be run from the same Ant script.
This exception is confirmed by IBM product support team. Same holds true for JMS ear creation. Only difference between the old ant script & new one is that wsdefaultbinding task is moved to new ant script file
